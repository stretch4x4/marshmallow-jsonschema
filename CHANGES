0.11.0 (unreleased)
    - drop support for python 2 & 3.5, as well as marshmallow 2.
      Python >= 3.6 and marshmallow >= 3 are now required!
      Python 3.5 should still work - no breaking changes yet,
      it just isn't a part of the build anymore.
    - add optional support for marshmallow_enum and marshmallow_union.
    - Include type of Dict values #127
      Add support for specifying the type of Dict values.
      Prior to this change any information about the values in a
      dict - particularly nested schemas - was lost.
