## Writing release notes

This repo uses the [towncrier](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier) tool for managing release notes.

When submitting a PR, please include a news fragment file in the [unreleased_notes](./unreleased_notes/) folder with the
issue number and an appropriate suffix chosen from the list of `directory` values under each `tool.towncrier.type`
heading in `pyproject.toml`. For example, the file `unreleased_notes/37.feature` would indicate a note for a feature
related to issue number #37.

The valid filename extensions are currently:

* .breaking
* .deprecation
* .feature
* .bugfix
* .refactor
* .doc
* .build
* .contrib

See the [towncrier docs](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for more details.
