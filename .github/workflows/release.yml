# This workflow is mostly copied from the official PyPA guide:
# https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/
#
# Note: There are improvements that could be made to streamline the release process further such as integrating helpers
#       like bump-my-version and towncrier
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1. Finalise development on the master branch
# 2. Update the version number in setup.py appropriately
# 3. Commit `git commit -m "vx.x.x release"`
# 4. Tag `git tag vx.x.x`
# 5. Push `git push && git push --tags`
# 6. This workflow will automatically be triggered in GitHub Actions based on the new tag
# 7. Update the version number in setup.py again to a development version e.g. v1.2.3.dev0
# 8. Push `git push`
